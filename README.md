The OpenShift Web Terminal offers an extensible solution to those who want to run CLI tools in a browswer based terminal.

NOTE: In process of moving this work from another repo [here](https://github.com/redhat-na-ssa/demo-ai-gitops-catalog) `https://github.com/redhat-na-ssa/demo-ai-gitops-catalog/tree/main/components/containers/web-terminal`

This repo is intended to provide additional tools and a pattern to customize the web terminal.
